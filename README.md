---

## 🏁 Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/eobarretooo/ClawLite.git
cd ClawLite
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -e .

# Or install optional integrations up front
python3 -m pip install -e ".[browser,telegram,media,runtime]"

# Optional browser runtime download
python3 -m playwright install chromium

# 2. Configure (interactive wizard — sets provider, gateway, optional Telegram)
clawlite configure

# 3. Start the gateway
clawlite gateway
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8787** → live dashboard with chat, automation, memory, and tools.

If you pass `--config path.yaml`, YAML configs work out of the box. Optional runtimes now install via extras: `.[browser]` for Playwright, `.[telegram]` for the Telegram channel, `.[media]` for TTS/PDF helpers, `.[runtime]` for Redis-backed bus support, and `.[observability]` for OTLP/OpenTelemetry exports.
Config profiles are also supported: `clawlite --config ./config.yaml --profile prod status` loads `config.yaml`, overlays `config.prod.yaml` if present, and then applies env vars.

**Android / Termux path:** use `proot-distro` with Ubuntu instead of trying to run the full stack directly on native Termux. The one-shot wrapper is:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eobarretooo/ClawLite/main/scripts/install_termux_proot.sh | bash
```

If an older `/root/ClawLite` checkout inside Ubuntu has diverged from `origin/main`, the wrapper now preserves it as a timestamped backup and reclones cleanly instead of failing on `git pull --ff-only`.
The Termux wrapper also fetches the latest checkout-sync helper directly from GitHub, so rerunning the one-shot `curl ... | bash` path is the safest update path even when an older local wrapper script is stale.

After that:

```bash
proot-distro login ubuntu --shared-tmp
clawlite configure --flow quickstart
clawlite gateway
```

Full walkthrough: [`docs/TERMUX_PROOT_UBUNTU.md`](docs/TERMUX_PROOT_UBUNTU.md)

```bash
# Or talk to the agent straight from the terminal
clawlite run "hello — what can you do?"
```

### Docker quickstart

ClawLite now ships an official Docker path:

```bash
bash scripts/docker_setup.sh
```

This persists state in `~/.clawlite`, exposes the dashboard on `http://127.0.0.1:8787`, and includes a CLI sidecar for one-shot commands like:

```bash
docker compose run --rm clawlite-cli status
docker compose run --rm clawlite-cli run "summarize the latest session"
```

If you want the Redis bus backend from Docker, enable the `redis` profile and the matching env overrides:

```bash
CLAWLITE_BUS_BACKEND=redis docker compose --profile redis up -d
```

The Docker image now runs as a non-root `clawlite` user by default. If your host UID/GID is not `1000`, export `CLAWLITE_UID` and `CLAWLITE_GID` before building or use the setup helper, which does that automatically.

## 📈 Current Status

- `v0.7.0-beta.0` is out, and it closes robustness phases 1-7 plus the full `plano.md` milestone on the beta track.
- `main` is now focused on soak-testing, documentation polish, and the next roadmap items rather than another large hardening pass.
- Local-provider startup, cron/jobs boundaries, browser lifecycle, skill networking policy, and Telegram runtime internals are hardened on `main`.
- The current Discord parity slice now includes DM/guild policy controls, guild/channel/role allowlists, bot gating, explicit session routing, configurable `reply_to_mode`, isolated native slash-command sessions, deferred interaction replies, static presence plus `auto_presence`, persistent `/focus` / `/unfocus` bindings, native `/discord-presence` controls, and automatic idle/max-age expiry for stale Discord focus bindings.
- The biggest runtime monoliths were split by responsibility: `clawlite/gateway/server.py` is down to about `3.3k` lines and `clawlite/core/memory.py` to about `4.4k`.
- Packaging is now split into extras: base install stays leaner, while `.[browser]`, `.[telegram]`, and `.[media]` enable optional runtimes.
- Skills now honor OpenClaw-style `skills.entries.<skill>` overrides for `enabled`, `env`, and `apiKey`, including profile overlays such as `config.prod.yaml`.
- Builtin skills can now be gated with `skills.allowBundled` without blocking workspace or marketplace overrides.
- Tool safety now supports granular specifiers such as `browser:evaluate`, `run_skill:github`, `exec:git`, `exec:shell`, and `exec:env-key:git-ssh-command`, plus approval mode via `approval_specifiers` / `approval_channels`, with `tool:*` wildcards for channel-specific policy.
- The default approval baseline is now safer out of the box: `browser:evaluate`, `exec`, `mcp`, and `run_skill` require approval on Telegram and Discord, and approval reviews are bound to the original requester when that actor identity is available.
- Actor-bound Telegram/Discord approval requests can still be inspected from the gateway or CLI, but the actual approve/reject step now stays on the native channel interaction instead of trusting a manually supplied actor string over the generic control plane. Generic HTTP approval reviews now record the reviewer as `control-plane`, and when a gateway token is configured the broader control-plane surface (`status`, dashboard state, chat, cron/control mutations, approvals/grants, and gateway WebSocket chat) now requires that token even on loopback. Root/assets/health stay open unless health auth is explicitly enabled.
- Authenticated dashboard state no longer echoes raw gateway secrets back to the browser payload: the handoff block keeps `gateway_url` and a masked token preview, but drops `gateway_token` and tokenized dashboard URLs from the runtime API response.
- The packaged dashboard now keeps the gateway token only in `sessionStorage` for the current tab, clears any legacy token copy from `localStorage`, and seeds live chat with a per-tab `dashboard:operator:<id>` session instead of a browser-wide shared default.
- Tool safety now also derives host-aware rules for `web_fetch` and `browser:navigate`, so operator policy can target specific destinations such as `web_fetch:host:example-com` instead of only whole-tool approvals.
- Explicit shell wrappers like `sh -lc`, `bash -lc`, and `cmd /c` now classify as `exec:shell` and are recursively guarded under workspace restriction, so they no longer bypass `restrict_to_workspace` by hiding path access behind `$HOME`, `~`, or similar expansions.
- `exec` and `process` now also block obvious `curl` / `wget` / PowerShell web fetches to localhost, private ranges, and metadata-style `http(s)` targets, closing a network-policy bypass that previously sat outside `web_fetch`.
- `exec` and `process` now also block the same internal `http(s)` targets when they appear inside obvious runtime fetch payloads such as `python -c`, `python -m urllib.request`, `node -e`, or `node -p`, including common transparent launch wrappers like `/usr/bin/env`, `env -i`, `env -S`, `nohup`, `nice`, `timeout`, or `stdbuf`, so generic interpreters cannot trivially sidestep `web_fetch` policy.
- `web_fetch` and `web_search` now label their payloads as untrusted external content and include a safety notice in the structured result, reducing prompt-injection risk without changing the main `text` contract that existing skills already consume.
- `browser.navigate` keeps an explicit “external page content” prefix, and prompt guidance now treats browser page reads plus browser evaluations as untrusted external data without breaking the raw `browser.evaluate` return contract for callers that need exact values.
- Inbound channel turns now pass a compact allowlisted subset of runtime metadata into the prompt as untrusted context, including safe structural hints like message/thread ids, DM/forum state, Slack thread timestamps, signed callback/button ids, and media markers without ingesting raw webhook payloads.
- Inbound channel text now also normalizes real newlines and neutralizes obvious spoof markers like `[System Message]`, bracketed `[Developer]`, or leading `System:` before that text reaches the agent loop.
- Direct gateway chat requests over HTTP/WebSocket can now forward optional `channel`, `chat_id`, and `runtime_metadata`, so manual operator/API traffic preserves the same untrusted runtime hints that native channel adapters already provide.
- WebSocket `chat.send` streaming now coalesces tiny provider chunks into larger `chat.chunk` events before the final response, reducing frame spam while preserving order and accumulated text.
- Completed-turn memory persistence now batches working-set writes when the backend supports it, and OpenAI-compatible provider streams can escalate pre-text tool-call turns back into the full engine loop before any visible text is emitted.
- When deferred turn persistence is enabled, those sync working-memory writes now run off the event loop, so a slow post-turn memory flush in one session no longer stalls unrelated sessions.
- That WebSocket chunk coalescing is now tunable under `gateway.websocket` (`coalesce_enabled`, `coalesce_min_chars`, `coalesce_max_chars`, `coalesce_profile`) while keeping the previous defaults.
- Scheduled cron turns and queued `agent_run` / `skill_exec` jobs now preserve explicit routing context (`channel`, `target` / `chat_id`, `runtime_metadata`) when that data is already present in the payload.
- `stream_run()` now falls back to the full agent loop for live lookup turns, explicit GitHub/Docker/web-search skill-routed turns, and summarize requests that clearly point at a URL or file, so streaming no longer takes a text-only shortcut when the runtime already knows the answer should go through operational tools or verified lookup.
- `stream_run()` now also keeps the same per-session lock through provider streaming cleanup, reuses the same completed-turn session/memory persistence path as `run()` for successful streams, avoids appending empty assistant rows when a provider ends the stream with an error chunk, and now honors mid-stream stop requests instead of draining the provider to the end.
- Completed turns now append session transcript rows first and defer the heavier memory-write work behind the response on the production runtime, while draining that per-session queue before the next same-session prompt and during CLI/gateway shutdown so memory state stays ordered.
- The `message` tool is now more honest about per-channel capabilities: Telegram keeps the richer action/media bridge, Discord supports send plus button components, and unsupported channels fail closed instead of silently pretending advanced actions exist.
- The prompt runtime-context block is now merged into the current user turn before provider calls, reducing provider-compatibility risk from adjacent `user` messages while preserving the same untrusted metadata semantics and raw session persistence.
- Approval-gated tool calls now surface interactive approve/reject controls in Telegram and Discord, backed by temporary request-bound grants so the operator can approve and then retry only that reviewed call safely.
- Operators can now review those pending tool approvals from the gateway or CLI with `clawlite tools approvals|approve|reject`, and revoke active temporary grants explicitly with `clawlite tools revoke-grant`. Approval snapshots now include structured context such as exec binary/env keys/cwd and browser or web host targets.
- Skills now include a dedicated `clawlite skills doctor` view that turns deterministic diagnostics into actionable remediation hints for missing env vars, binaries, config keys, and bundled-skill policy blocks, with optional `--status` / `--source` / `--query` filters for operator triage.
- Managed skills now expose richer local lifecycle state in the CLI, including aggregate `status_counts` plus resolved marketplace state after `install`, `update`, `sync`, and `remove`. `skills search` also includes matching locally managed skills for quick operator triage.
- `clawlite skills config <name>` now gives the operator a direct path to inspect or update `skills.entries.<skillKey>` in the active config/profile, including `apiKey`, per-skill `env`, and `enabled` overrides without editing JSON/YAML manually.
- Workspace defaults no longer inject fake user profile values like `Owner`, and explicit “search on the internet / latest” requests now add a web-research requirement so the engine is pushed toward `web_search` / `web_fetch` before answering.
- Telegram outbound rendering now cleans up inline numbered lists, markdown headings, and pipe tables into more readable channel-safe HTML.
- Phase 7 is complete on `main`: `self_evolution` now uses provider-direct proposal, pre-apply patch policy, isolated git worktree branches, configurable branch prefixes, and Telegram/Discord approval callbacks that record human review state while staying disabled by default.
- Gateway startup now uses per-subsystem timeouts, so a slow channel transport no longer blocks the whole control plane from coming up.
- OAuth-backed free-tier cloud setup now includes `gemini-oauth` and `qwen-oauth` alongside `openai-codex`.
- File-backed `gemini-oauth` and `qwen-oauth` providers now refresh expired access tokens once on `401`, persist the renewed token back into the local CLI auth file, and retry the request automatically.
- The onboarding wizard now suggests provider-specific model ids, expected base URLs, and OAuth re-login hints before it probes the selected provider.
- Wizard coverage now also includes `azure-openai`, `aihubmix`, `siliconflow`, and `cerebras`, matching the current OpenClaw/nanobot parity slice for OpenAI-compatible providers.
- Prompt/context hardening on `main` now includes larger history budget allocation, optional semantic compression for trimmed history, optional oversized tool-result compaction, workspace prompt file byte ceilings, and explicit per-tool timeout overrides through `tools.timeouts.<tool>`.
- The cron control plane now exposes richer operational state: `/v1/cron/status`, expanded `/v1/cron/list`, per-job inspection, and native enable/disable controls on top of the existing scheduler.
- Runtime scale-out and observability are now in place as opt-in surfaces: Redis bus backend, OTLP telemetry hooks, session TTL, history compaction, `sqlite-vec`, and `memory_compact`.
- Latest validation on `main`: `python -m pytest tests -q --tb=short` → `1782 passed, 1 skipped`; `python -m pytest -q tests/runtime/test_autonomy_actions.py tests/gateway/test_server.py tests/runtime/test_self_evolution.py` → `194 passed`; `bash scripts/smoke_test.sh` → `7 ok / 0 failure(s)`.
- Tracking docs: [`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md) and [`docs/ROBUSTNESS_SCORECARD.md`](docs/ROBUSTNESS_SCORECARD.md).
- The next major execution track is the OpenClaw parity push for Docker, Discord, tools, and skills.

OpenAI Codex · Gemini OAuth · Qwen OAuth

**OpenAI Codex**

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "providers": {
      "openai_codex": {
        "access_token": "oauth-token",

## 🏛️ Architecture

ClawLite has four main layers:

**1. Channels** — inbound/outbound adapters for Telegram, Discord, Email, WhatsApp, Slack, and the CLI. All normalize to the same internal message format before hitting the gateway.

**2. FastAPI Gateway** (`:8787`) — HTTP + WebSocket server, operator dashboard, auth, and channel dispatch. Single entry point for all traffic.

**3. Agent Engine** — the core loop. On each turn it builds a prompt from memory + identity + workspace files, calls tools as needed, and streams tokens from LiteLLM (20+ providers). `run()` and `stream_run()` now share the same base prompt shaping and session-lock discipline for memory, history, and runtime context, and `stream_run()` falls back to the full `run()` loop on live-lookup turns plus obvious summarize URL/file routes so tool-backed answers do not stay on a text-only path. Loop detection, context window budgeting, and subagent orchestration all live here.

**4. Supporting layers** always running in the background:
- **Memory** — hybrid BM25 + vector search, FTS5, temporal decay, SQLite or pgvector
- **Supervisor** — heartbeat, cron, autonomy wake, dead-letter replay, background job queue

**Request flow:** user message → channel adapter → gateway → engine (memory retrieval + tool calls + LLM stream) → response streamed back → memory updated.

## 🧬 Inspired By

ClawLite draws ideas from two open-source agent runtimes:

- **[openclaw](https://github.com/eobarretooo/openclaw)** — TypeScript agent runtime with the richest feature set; primary reference for channel adapters, tool interfaces, and operator dashboard design
- **[nanobot](https://github.com/eobarretooo/nanobot)** — minimal Python agent; reference for clean core architecture and skill packaging

ClawLite is a Python-first reimplementation with a focus on local deployment, persistent memory, and production-grade channel support.
