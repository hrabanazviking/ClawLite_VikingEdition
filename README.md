## ⚡ What Is ClawLite
ClawLite is a practical autonomous assistant focused on execution: it receives messages, runs tools, stores memory, schedules jobs, and sends proactive updates through channels.
Unlike heavier alternatives, ClawLite is intentionally compact: around **4.2k lines of focused Python core code** designed for personal operation and fast iteration.

## ✨ Main Features
- 🧠 **Unified agent engine** for CLI, HTTP API, WebSocket, scheduler, and channels.
- 💬 **Telegram-first channel support** with allowlist validation and long-message chunking.
- 🛡️ **Telegram reliability mechanisms**: retry/backoff with jitter, auth circuit breaker for 401/403, typing keepalive during processing with a separate typing auth circuit breaker, formatting fallback, and safe offset commit only after successful processing.
- 🧩 **Skills via `SKILL.md`** with autoload and executable `command/script` actions.
- 🗓️ **Autonomous scheduling** with Cron jobs and heartbeat loops.
- 🧭 **Runtime supervisor** for health checks and bounded self-recovery with cooldown protections.
- 🤖 **Autonomy bootstrap worker (opt-in)** for periodic supervised self-review turns with backlog/cooldown guards, timeout containment, and manual trigger control.
- 🗂️ **Persistent memory + sessions** stored under `~/.clawlite/state`.
- 🔌 **Multi-provider LLM support** (Gemini, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, Anthropic routing, Codex, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints).
- 🧯 **Provider reliability controls**: bounded retry/backoff (+ jitter), provider circuit breaker, additive provider diagnostics, and optional fallback model failover for retryable failures.
- 🛠️ **Tool execution** for shell, files, web, cron, message routing, skills, and subagents.

## 🚀 Quick Start (4 Steps)
1. **Clone and install**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eobarretooo/ClawLite.git
cd ClawLite
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -e .
```

2. **Initialize workspace identity files**
```bash
clawlite onboard
```

3. **Create minimal config** (`~/.clawlite/config.json`)
```json
{
  "provider": {
    "model": "gemini/gemini-2.5-flash"
  },
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "123456789:AA...",
      "allow_from": ["1850513297"]
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Export API key and start gateway**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."
clawlite start --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Health check:
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
```

## 🔧 Minimal Config (Gemini + Telegram)
ClawLite loads config from `~/.clawlite/config.json` by default.

```json
{
  "workspace_path": "/home/your-user/.clawlite/workspace",
  "state_path": "/home/your-user/.clawlite/state",
  "provider": {
    "model": "gemini/gemini-2.5-flash"
  },
  "gateway": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 8787
  },
  "scheduler": {
    "heartbeat_interval_seconds": 1800,
    "timezone": "UTC"
  },
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "123456789:AA...",
      "allow_from": ["1850513297"],
      "poll_timeout_s": 20,
      "poll_interval_s": 1.0
    }
  }
}
```

Environment overrides supported:

  --prompt "Remind me to review release notes" \
  --name "release-reminder"
```

List active jobs:
```bash
clawlite cron list --session-id telegram:1850513297

  }
}
```

## 📊 Status Snapshot (2026-03-03)
- **Working now**
  - Gateway/API v1 endpoints are implemented and documented (`/health`, `/v1/chat`, `/v1/cron/*`, `/v1/ws`).
  - Telegram channel is the only production channel today, with polling, retry/backoff (+ jitter), 401/403 auth circuit breaker, typing keepalive with dedicated typing auth circuit protection, allowlist checks, chunked outbound, formatting fallback, and safe offset commit after successful processing.
  - Telegram reliability test coverage now includes deterministic soak/recovery-style validation for repeated reconnect and outbound transient retry cycles, plus mixed-failure chaos/recovery matrix scenarios (chunking, formatting fallback, 429 retry-after, timeout, and multi-cycle polling recovery).
  - Core loop persistence is now fail-soft: response delivery is preserved when session append or memory consolidation fails, with degraded-mode logging for recovery visibility.
  - Gateway diagnostics now expose additive engine persistence telemetry and session-store durability/recovery counters when diagnostics config exposure is enabled.
  - Long-term memory/session recovery hardening landed: malformed memory JSONL read-repair, per-session context recovery fallback when session history is missing, and additive memory/session recovery diagnostics in engine telemetry.
  - Tool I/O reliability hardening landed: additive tool execution telemetry in engine diagnostics, deterministic `exec` invalid-syntax/truncation safeguards, and safer MCP timeout/network/HTTP/invalid-response handling with bounded retry.
  - Provider reliability hardening landed: fail-soft retry taxonomy (429 non-quota + 5xx + network/timeout), Retry-After support, provider circuit breaker telemetry, and optional one-hop fallback model failover.
  - Scheduler is active with both Cron jobs and Heartbeat loop, plus CLI/API controls.
  - Gateway runtime supervisor is active with additive health telemetry and bounded auto-recovery checks for heartbeat/cron/channel runtime health, plus cooldown-based restart-storm protection.
  - Autonomy loop bootstrap is active as an opt-in gateway subsystem: periodic supervised review turns with bounded timeout, queue-backlog/cooldown guards, additive diagnostics, and manual `/v1/control/autonomy/trigger` control.
  - P1 proactive delivery observability is active: additive outbound/dead-letter telemetry in queue/channel diagnostics plus bounded dead-letter replay control via API.
  - Scheduler reliability telemetry hardening landed: heartbeat/cron now expose additive durability counters, trigger/reason/job health signals, and isolate transient persistence/schedule/job failures without crashing runtime loops.
  - Provider routing is active for Gemini, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, Anthropic routing, Codex, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
  - Core tools and workspace templates are live: shell/files/web/cron/message/skills/subagent tools and `IDENTITY`, `SOUL`, `AGENTS`, `TOOLS`, `USER`, `HEARTBEAT`, `BOOTSTRAP`, `memory/MEMORY`.
- **Known gaps**
  - Telegram reliability is improved with long-run soak/recovery validation coverage, but not yet a guaranteed zero-error operation under all network/provider conditions.
  - Typing keepalive cadence/TTL tuning and richer Telegram formatting consistency still need more production validation.
  - Most non-Telegram channels are still skeleton adapters.
  - 24/7 supervision/recovery bootstrap is active and autonomy periodic review bootstrap is available, but full autonomous self-improvement loops with internet research and quality gates remain in progress.

## 🛣️ Roadmap
- **P0 Reliability and Core Completion (highest priority)**
  - [ ] Telegram at near-100% reliability: typing signal, formatting stability, resilient retries, and zero-crash channel loop (inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) + [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) reliability targets).
  - [ ] ClawLite core loop fully reliable across Memory, Agents, Heartbeat, Soul context, Tools, and User context.
  - [ ] Gateway v1 stability hardening with expanded integration tests for `/v1/chat`, `/v1/cron/*`, and scheduler dispatch.
  - [x] Provider/runtime robustness: safer auth/config validation, clearer provider error taxonomy, stronger fallback/retry behavior, and additive provider telemetry.
- **P1 Capability Expansion**
  - [ ] Skills system at production quality: discovery, execution diagnostics, guardrails, and repeatable outcomes (OpenClaw/nanobot inspired operator UX).
  - [ ] Subagents at production quality: queue/retry/resume reliability, better observability, and practical delegation flows.
  - [ ] Move from supervised automation to truly autonomous operation with controlled guardrails.
  - [ ] Main objective: autonomous and intelligent self-improvement 24/7 with internet research loops and measurable quality gates.
- **P2 Ecosystem and Collaboration**
  - [ ] Future collaboration network: OpenClaw + nanobot + ClawLite working together in Telegram/Discord group workflows.
  - [ ] Codex 5.3 xhigh + agents/subagents applied to GitHub operations (posts, PRs, commits, releases, READMEs, docs, architecture notes, and continuous learning tasks).
  - [ ] Dashboard for transparent progress tracking, total time spent, and an agent reward system for delivered outcomes.
  - [ ] Vision (concise): `final objective = real autonomy, continuous improvement, and collaboration among agents`.
