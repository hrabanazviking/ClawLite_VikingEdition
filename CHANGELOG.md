## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Packaged dashboard shell served from `/` with status, diagnostics, sessions, automation views, tool catalog, token handling, live chat, event feed, autorefresh, and heartbeat controls over the existing gateway contract.
- Project status, autonomy execution plan, operator runbook, and release workflow docs for the current hardening cycle.
- OpenClaw-compatible filesystem and memory tool aliases to reduce migration friction (`663a8f0`).
- Native `apply_patch` and process-control tools for safer in-agent file edits and runtime operations (`a858966`).
- Session orchestration and background subagent tools in the runtime tool surface (`5e9d829`).
- Gateway tools catalog capability exposure for dashboard/runtime introspection (`6cd00df`).
- Additional OpenClaw operational skills ported into ClawLite (`461180d`, `f6be3f4`).

### Changed
- Refreshed the root README with a richer quickstart, examples, capability matrix, and clearer explanation of the current autonomy-hardening phase.
- Onboarding now emits a tokenized dashboard link, and the dashboard can bootstrap auth from the URL fragment before stripping it from the address bar; when bootstrap is pending it also exposes a one-click hatch action for the first defining turn.
- Added a dedicated `clawlite dashboard` command so operators can reopen or print the current dashboard handoff without rerunning onboarding, including backup/web-search/security guidance and bootstrap-state hints; the packaged dashboard now renders those next-step notes too.
- Fixed `clawlite start` and `clawlite gateway` so `--config` now flows into the runtime instead of silently falling back to the default config file.
- Bootstrap completion is now gated behind the dedicated hatch session, and `clawlite hatch` provides a terminal-first way to run that first defining turn safely.
- Failover diagnostics now keep auth/quota suppression reasons visible and apply longer cooldown windows so broken or exhausted providers are not hammered repeatedly.
- The dashboard automation view now surfaces provider suppression/cooldown candidates as operator cards instead of only raw JSON.
- The dashboard automation view now also surfaces delivery queues, dead-letter pressure, channel recovery loops, and supervisor recovery budgets as operator cards.
- Operators can now trigger live dead-letter replay from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/replay` and the dashboard automation view.
- Operators can now trigger live channel recovery from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/recover` and the dashboard automation view.
- Operators can now trigger live inbound journal replay from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/inbound-replay` and the dashboard automation view.
- Operators can now inspect Telegram offset/pairing/webhook state in the dashboard and trigger a live Telegram transport refresh via `POST /v1/control/channels/telegram/refresh`.
- Operators can now approve pending Telegram pairing codes from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/telegram/pairing/approve` and the dashboard.
- Heartbeat prompts now inject a cron-style current-time line from the workspace user timezone and skip model calls when `HEARTBEAT.md` exists but is effectively empty.
- Gateway root entrypoint now serves a richer operator dashboard backed by packaged HTML/CSS/JS assets instead of a single inline landing page, with a more operational UI/UX direction for control-plane work.
- Added dashboard state endpoints (`/v1/dashboard/state`, `/api/dashboard/state`) so the packaged UI can render recent sessions, cron state, channels, provider recovery, and self-evolution summaries without scraping raw diagnostics.
- Expanded dashboard-state payloads so the UI can render workspace runtime health, bootstrap cycle state, skills inventory summary, and memory monitor telemetry.
- Added workspace onboarding-state tracking inspired by `ref/openclaw`, so bootstrap seeding/completion survives across syncs and the dashboard can report onboarding progress more accurately.
- Synced README, docs index, and roadmap with the real repository state, validation commands, and milestone workflow.
- Enforced ClawLite identity in prompts and emitted outputs to avoid assistant-name drift (`6d5c99a`).
- Added layered tool policy resolution, then tightened tool-policy handling across memory-forget and run-skill paths (`e1a0033`, `1203c64`, `f6592b2`).
- Hardened long-running reliability for provider retries, channel dispatch/reuse, gateway background tasks, cron execution, and memory compaction/monitor persistence (`da50a2a`, `017844f`, `aefaade`, `2e891b1`, `60773a5`).
- Improved worker/session control with fail-closed spawn policy, bounded process sessions/output buffers, and lock-safe subagent cancel/synthesize (`a122d8e`, `5df5d81`, `33f28ca`).

### Fixed
- Reduced SSRF risk in web tooling with DNS-drift protections and explicit peer-IP verification (`67b52e3`, `d7e0e11`).
- Switched gateway secret comparisons to constant-time checks (`62bdf45`).
- Made key persistence paths atomic/durable (config writes, `apply_patch` writes, cron state fsync-before-replace) (`58d2136`, `4f05059`, `9075e8c`).
- Added timeout guards to gateway engine runs, session runners, and cron callbacks to prevent stuck loops (`64e5b02`, `a122d8e`, `2e891b1`).
- Restored provider tool schema/Codex tool-call compatibility and hardened MCP transport retries (`4077792`, `75e154e`).

### Removed
- No explicit removals in this release window.

### Technical/Agentic Session
- [SESSION ID: CLAWLITE-UNRELEASED-HARDENING] - Focus: post-beta hardening for safety, reliability, and runtime control.
- **Objective:** consolidate high-risk fixes and OpenClaw-compatibility tooling while preserving ClawLite behavior under sustained operation.

### Technical Changes
- Added identity enforcement, OpenClaw-compatible aliases, `apply_patch`/process tools, and session/subagent orchestration tools.
- Introduced layered tool-policy resolution and gateway tools catalog exposure.
- Hardened provider/channel/gateway/cron/memory paths with bounded buffers, retries, timeouts, async offloading, and lock-safe cancellation.
- Applied security controls across web-fetch SSRF checks, constant-time gateway auth compare, and atomic/durable file writes.

### Design Decisions
- Prioritized defense-in-depth and fail-closed defaults on runtime-critical paths.
- Scoped changes to commit-backed hardening milestones instead of introducing new feature domains.

### Verification Status
- Verified through iterative runtime smoke paths, gateway execution-timeout checks, cron stability checks, and regression fixes shipped as focused patches.

## [v0.5.0-beta.2] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- New modular subsystem implementations for engine, dynamic tools, event bus, channels, scheduler, providers, session store, config loader, workspace templates, gateway, and CLI command interface (`c729d9b`, `1de0a80`, `153eedc`, `c9dd253`, `1dd1e7e`, `e4e6d24`, `c7f0d33`, `ac5537e`, `0593ea9`, `3afa9d5`, `6dba831`).

- Reduced decomposition regressions by normalizing shared helper usage and keeping runtime request interfaces consistent (`e0bc442`, `f95446b`).

### Removed
- Removed legacy architecture stack and obsolete skill/docs bundles that conflicted with the rewritten modular core (`e3aa896`, `6138228`).

### Technical/Agentic Session
- [SESSION ID: CLAWLITE-V050B2-MODULAR-REWRITE] - Focus: full modular architecture migration with legacy retirement.
- **Objective:** transition ClawLite from a tightly coupled runtime to explicit subsystem boundaries without breaking core operator workflows.

### Technical Changes
- Split runtime responsibilities into dedicated modules across core execution, tools, bus, channels, scheduling, providers, session/config/workspace, gateway, and CLI.
- Unified orchestration through shared request/response contracts and AgentLoop-based routing.
- Replaced legacy bundles with package-local skill discovery and updated docs/runtime conventions.

### Design Decisions
- Established module boundaries before feature parity expansion to limit regression blast radius.
- Removed legacy paths once equivalent modular paths were live to avoid dual-stack drift.

### Verification Status
- Completed via staged integration checks across gateway chat/ws/health flows, channel/cron routing, and CLI startup/onboarding smoke runs.
