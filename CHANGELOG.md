# Changelog

All notable changes to ClawLite are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- official Docker foundation with `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docs/DOCKER.md`, and host-mounted `~/.clawlite` runtime state
- persisted Discord focus bindings with `/focus` / `/unfocus`, routed through the inbound interceptor before the agent loop

### Changed
- refreshed README/docs status snapshot to point at the new Docker path and the active parity track
- Discord policy/routing parity slice now includes DM/guild policy controls, guild/channel/role allowlists, bot gating, explicit session keys, configurable `reply_to_mode`, isolated slash sessions, deferred interaction replies, and persisted thread/channel bindings with idle/max-age expiry
- Discord operator flows now include native `/discord-status` and `/discord-refresh` commands handled before the agent loop

### Fixed
- `stream_run()` now reuses the same base prompt shaping as `run()` for memory, history, and allowlisted runtime metadata, instead of streaming from raw session rows only
- `stream_run()` now falls back to the full `run()` loop for live-lookup turns, instead of staying on a text-only provider stream path when the answer should be verified with current web/weather data
- prompt runtime context now includes a few more safe structural channel hints such as message IDs, Slack thread timestamps, Telegram forum state, Discord DM state, signed callback/button ids, and single media-type markers without exposing raw channel payloads
- `exec` and `process` now also block internal `http(s)` targets inside obvious inline runtime fetch payloads such as `python -c` and `node -e`, closing another path around `web_fetch` network policy
- the inline-runtime network guard now also resolves common transparent launch wrappers such as `/usr/bin/env`, `env -i`, `env -S`, `command --`, `nohup`, `nice`, `timeout`, and `stdbuf`, closing another set of `exec` / `process` bypasses around `web_fetch` policy
- the same guard now also covers explicit runtime modes like `node -p` and `python -m urllib.request`, closing a few more interpreter-level bypasses without blocking non-network module invocations
- `AgentEngine` now marks synthesized subagent digests with the async-safe subagent API inside the live event loop, so completed digest runs no longer leak back into later turns
- engine regressions that inspect exact tool/tool-call history now use hermetic in-memory session state instead of machine-local persisted rows
- cron scheduler regression coverage now waits on an explicit callback event instead of a fixed sleep, removing a suite-load race in `test_cron_service_add_and_run`
- `exec` and `process` now treat explicit shell wrappers such as `sh -lc`, `bash -lc`, and `cmd /c` as nested shell executions for workspace guarding, so `$HOME` / `~` style path expansion can no longer bypass `restrict_to_workspace`
- `exec` and `process` now block obvious `curl` / `wget` / PowerShell `http(s)` fetches to localhost, private ranges, and metadata-style targets, closing a network-policy bypass that sat outside `web_fetch`
- `web_fetch` and `web_search` now mark successful payloads as untrusted external content and include a safety notice so fetched pages/snippets are treated as data rather than instructions
- prompt guidance now treats browser page reads and browser evaluations as untrusted external data, while `browser.navigate` keeps the explicit external-content notice and `browser.evaluate` preserves its raw return contract
- inbound channel turns now inject a compact allowlisted subset of runtime metadata into the untrusted prompt context, so reply/thread/command/media hints reach the model without exposing raw webhook payloads
- inbound channel text now normalizes real CRLF/CR newlines and neutralizes obvious spoof markers like `[System Message]` or line-leading `System:` before it reaches the agent loop
- direct gateway chat turns over HTTP and WebSocket now forward optional `channel`, `chat_id`, and `runtime_metadata` into the engine, preserving the same safe runtime-context path used by native channel adapters
- cron dispatch and queued `agent_run` / `skill_exec` jobs now preserve explicit routing context (`channel`, `target` / `chat_id`, `runtime_metadata`) when that metadata is already present in the job payload
- inbound channel text now also neutralizes bracketed `[Developer]` role-spoof markers before channel traffic reaches the agent loop, while keeping noisier prefixes like `Assistant:` and `Tool:` untouched for now
- `stream_run()` now also falls back to the full `run()` loop for explicit GitHub and Docker skill-routed turns, reducing another class of streaming/text-only divergence without broadly disabling provider streaming
- `stream_run()` now also falls back to the full `run()` loop for summarize requests that clearly reference a URL or local file when the summarize skill is available, so tool-backed summary turns no longer stay on the text-only streaming path
- the untrusted runtime-context block is now merged into the current user turn before provider calls, avoiding another provider-compatibility edge around adjacent `user` messages without changing what gets persisted to session history
- gateway WebSocket streaming now coalesces tiny provider chunks into fewer `chat.chunk` events before the final response, reducing frame spam without changing ordering or accumulated text semantics
- gateway WebSocket chunk coalescing is now configurable under `gateway.websocket`, while preserving the existing default buffering behavior and `chat.chunk` contract
- gateway WebSocket coalescing now also supports configurable delivery profiles (`compact`, `newline`, `paragraph`, `raw`) so different WS clients can choose how aggressively chunks are grouped without changing the engine stream itself
- the default approval baseline now requires review for `browser:evaluate`, `exec`, `mcp`, and `run_skill` on Telegram and Discord, instead of leaving those channels opt-in by default
- approval-gated tool reviews now fail closed when a different actor tries to approve someone else's request on channels where the original requester identity is known
- actor-bound Telegram/Discord approval requests can no longer be approved through the generic gateway/CLI review path just by replaying the expected actor string; those reviews now stay on the native channel interaction path unless stronger control-plane identity is added later
- generic HTTP approval/grant endpoints now require the configured gateway token even on loopback, and generic reviews stamp the reviewer as `control-plane` instead of trusting a caller-supplied actor label
- `stream_run()` now keeps the per-session lock through provider-stream cleanup and persists even empty completed turns, reducing another class of state divergence versus `run()`
- successful `stream_run()` turns now reuse the same session/memory persistence path as `run()`, while provider-error done-chunks stop short of appending empty assistant rows into session history
- the main-turn memory planner now probes a smaller initial search window before widening the same query, reducing the common retrieval cost when early memory hits are already sufficient
- active `stream_run()` sessions now honor stop requests mid-stream instead of draining the provider to the end, and cancelled streams skip assistant persistence while finishing with an explicit stop chunk
- the `message` tool now exposes a more honest per-channel contract: Discord supports send plus button components, Telegram keeps the richer action/media bridge, and unsupported channels fail closed for advanced actions/buttons/media
- production runtimes now batch transcript appends per turn and defer heavier memory persistence behind the response while draining that per-session queue before the next prompt and on CLI/gateway shutdown
- completed-turn working-memory persistence now prefers a single batch write when the memory backend supports it, reducing post-turn working-set flush overhead without changing transcript durability
- deferred post-turn working-memory writes now move sync memory-store I/O off the event loop, so one session's background flush does not stall unrelated sessions
- `stream_run()` now also falls back to the full `run()` loop for explicit `web_search` / `web-search` routing requests instead of staying on a raw provider stream when the operator already asked for a live search path
- OpenAI-compatible provider streaming now advertises pre-text tool-call turns back to the engine, so `stream_run()` can fall back to the full tool loop before emitting visible text instead of getting stuck on a text-only stream path
- when a gateway token is configured, the broader control-plane surface now requires it even on loopback, including `status`, dashboard state, chat, cron/control mutations, approvals/grants, and gateway WebSocket chat, while root/assets/health stay open unless separately protected
- authenticated dashboard state now redacts raw handoff secrets, keeping only `gateway_url` and a masked token preview instead of echoing `gateway_token` or tokenized dashboard URLs back through the runtime API
- the packaged dashboard now keeps its gateway token only in `sessionStorage` for the current browser tab, clears any legacy `localStorage` copy on load/clear, and defaults live chat to a per-tab `dashboard:operator:<id>` session instead of a shared browser-wide operator route

## [v0.7.0-beta.0] - 2026-03-17

### Phase 7 — Advanced memory and self-improvement (`main`, 2026-03-17)
- `self_evolution` now uses provider-direct proposal instead of the full agent/tool loop
- unsafe proposals are rejected before apply via file/path/header/diff-size policy
- successful runs now commit only inside isolated git worktree branches, leaving the live checkout untouched
- operator notices are routed through the real autonomy notice path and surfaced in diagnostics with `last_branch`
- added end-to-end smoke coverage for isolated self-evolution runs plus CI/smoke-script wiring
- `self_evolution` now supports dry-run review, configurable branch prefixes, approval-required mode, and Telegram/Discord approval callbacks that persist review state

### Plan Milestone — `plano.md` completion (2026-03-17)
- Added file-based config profiles (`config.<profile>.yaml|json`) with CLI `--profile` support and documented merge precedence
- Completed engine loop recovery with a single meta-prompt retry before fail-closed abort
- Finished incremental streaming UX for Discord, Telegram progress integration, and websocket streaming alignment

- Kept `self_evolution` disabled by default while adding approval-ready notices and isolated branch workflows

### Robustness Milestone — Phases 1–5 (2026-03-15)

#### Phase 5 — Runtime recovery and operational autonomy (`e8ddaf1`)
- Fix critical bug: `JobQueue.start()` was never called — jobs submitted via `jobs` tool now execute
- `JobQueue.worker_status()`: live health snapshot (workers_alive, pending_jobs, running_jobs)
- `job_workers` lifecycle component: started in gateway startup sequence alongside other subsystems
- `_run_job_dispatch`: worker function supporting `agent_run` and `skill_exec` job kinds
- `RuntimeSupervisor` now monitors `job_workers`: detects dead worker pool and auto-restarts
- `SupervisorComponentPolicy` for `job_workers` (max_recoveries=8 per hour)
- `autonomy_stuck` supervisor detection: non-recoverable incident emitted when
  `consecutive_error_count >= 5` or `no_progress_streak >= 3` in the autonomy service
- 8 new tests: worker_status lifecycle, supervisor incident/recovery, job execution after late start

#### Phase 4 — Core engine hardening + background jobs (`d91a585`)
- `ContextWindowManager` — trims message history to model token budget; preserves system message and last user turn; `budget_chars` or `budget_tokens` constructor
- `TurnBudget.max_tool_calls` + `token_budget` fields — per-turn hard caps enforced in engine loop
- Engine loop-detection now emits `InboundEvent(channel="_system", text="loop_detected")` on the message bus for all three detectors (provider-plan, tool-repeat, ping-pong)
- `JobQueue` — priority async job queue with submit/status/cancel/list, concurrency control, and retry; fixed worker loop to drain pre-start submissions
- `JobJournal` — SQLite persistence for jobs (restart recovery via `restore_from_journal()`)
- `JobsTool` — agent-facing tool for submit/status/cancel/list background jobs
- `JobsConfig` — `AppConfig.jobs` sub-schema (`persist_enabled`, `persist_path`, `worker_concurrency`)
- Gateway: `JobsTool` registered, `JobQueue` wired with optional journal, `engine._bus` set for loop observability
- CLI: `clawlite jobs list|status|cancel` commands
- `SubagentManager.spawn(parent_session_id=...)` — child session prefixed `"{parent}:sub:{run_id[:8]}"`, stored in `run.metadata`

#### Phase 3 — Provider telemetry + tool resilience (`8455a59`)
- `TelemetryRegistry` + `ProviderTelemetry`: ring buffer 1000 calls/model, p50/p95 latency
- `ProviderChunk.degraded`: mid-stream recovery without exception propagation
- `LiteLLMProvider.warmup()`: connectivity probe before serving traffic
- `ToolError` + `ToolTimeoutError`: structured tool exceptions
- `ToolHealthResult` + `health_check()`: ExecTool, BrowserTool, MCPTool, PdfReadTool
- `ToolResultCache`: LRU 256 entries, 5min TTL; web_fetch + pdf_read cacheable
- `ToolRegistry` centralised timeout middleware
- `GET /metrics/providers`, `/health/providers`, `/health/tools`

#### Phase 2 — Memory hierarchy + proactive loader (`bf671ab`)
- `ResourceContext` dataclass + `resources`/`record_resources` SQLite tables
- `MemoryRecord` extended with `resource_id` + `consolidated` fields
- `ProactiveContextLoader`: background topic extraction + threaded recall with 30s cache TTL
- `LLMConsolidator`: LLM-driven consolidation with deterministic fallback
- `MemoryStore.ingest_file()`: .txt / .md / .pdf
- Memory TTL: `set_record_ttl` / `get_record_ttl` / `purge_expired_records` + `memory_ttl` table

#### Phase 1 — Config hot-reload + bus journal (`8dd97a9`)
- `ConfigWatcher`: watchfiles-based hot-reload with 500ms debounce and error-resilient reload
- `config_health()` + `GET /health/config`
- `ConfigAudit` ring buffer (last 5 configs)
- `BusConfig` in `AppConfig` (`journal_enabled`, `journal_path`)
- `BusJournal`: SQLite append/ack journal; survives restart; replay unacked messages
- `subscribe("*")` wildcard + `BusFullError` on `nowait=True` overflow
- `InboundEvent` / `OutboundEvent` typed envelopes with `envelope_version` + `correlation_id`

### Added
- Config schema fully migrated to Pydantic v2 (`clawlite/config/schema.py`) — all fields modelled with `Field`, validators, `model_validate`, and camelCase alias support (`1c60256`).
- `Base.from_dict()` classmethod on all Pydantic config models as a v1→v2 compatibility shim (`d3f8ee4`).
- `BrowserTool` (Playwright headless), `TTSTool` (edge-tts), and `PdfReadTool` (pypdf) registered in the gateway tool surface.
- Skills: `notion`, `obsidian`, `github-issues`, `spotify`, `docker`, `1password`, `apple-notes`, `trello`, `linear`, `jira` — full portfolio of 25+ integrated skills.
- `skill_creator.py` — runtime skill authoring from inside an agent session.
- Workspace templates: `AGENTS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `USER.md` — loaded and auto-repaired by `Workspace.Loader`.
- `scripts/make_demo_gif.py` — Playwright + Pillow animated README demo generator (`2c925f0`).
- Packaged dashboard shell served from `/` with status, diagnostics, sessions, automation views, tool catalog, token handling, live chat, event feed, autorefresh, and heartbeat controls over the existing gateway contract.
- Project status, autonomy execution plan, operator runbook, and release workflow docs for the current hardening cycle.
- OpenClaw-compatible filesystem and memory tool aliases to reduce migration friction (`663a8f0`).
- Native `apply_patch` and process-control tools for safer in-agent file edits and runtime operations (`a858966`).
- Session orchestration and background subagent tools in the runtime tool surface (`5e9d829`).
- Gateway tools catalog capability exposure for dashboard/runtime introspection (`6cd00df`).
- Additional OpenClaw operational skills ported into ClawLite (`461180d`, `f6be3f4`).

### Changed
- Refreshed the root README with a richer quickstart, examples, capability matrix, and clearer explanation of the current autonomy-hardening phase.
- Onboarding now emits a tokenized dashboard link, and the dashboard can bootstrap auth from the URL fragment before stripping it from the address bar; when bootstrap is pending it also exposes a one-click hatch action for the first defining turn.
- Added a dedicated `clawlite dashboard` command so operators can reopen or print the current dashboard handoff without rerunning onboarding, including backup/web-search/security guidance and bootstrap-state hints; the packaged dashboard now renders those next-step notes too.
- Fixed `clawlite start` and `clawlite gateway` so `--config` now flows into the runtime instead of silently falling back to the default config file.
- Bootstrap completion is now gated behind the dedicated hatch session, and `clawlite hatch` provides a terminal-first way to run that first defining turn safely.
- Failover diagnostics now keep auth/quota suppression reasons visible and apply longer cooldown windows so broken or exhausted providers are not hammered repeatedly.
- The dashboard automation view now surfaces provider suppression/cooldown candidates as operator cards instead of only raw JSON.
- The dashboard automation view now also surfaces delivery queues, dead-letter pressure, channel recovery loops, and supervisor recovery budgets as operator cards.
- Operators can now trigger live dead-letter replay from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/replay` and the dashboard automation view.
- Operators can now trigger live channel recovery from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/recover` and the dashboard automation view.
- Operators can now trigger live inbound journal replay from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/inbound-replay` and the dashboard automation view.
- Operators can now inspect Telegram offset/pairing/webhook state in the dashboard and trigger a live Telegram transport refresh via `POST /v1/control/channels/telegram/refresh`.
- Operators can now approve pending Telegram pairing codes from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/telegram/pairing/approve` and the dashboard.
- Operators can now deliberately advance the Telegram offset watermark from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/telegram/offset/commit`.
- Operators can now synchronize Telegram `next_offset` from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/telegram/offset/sync` and the CLI.
- Operators can now reset Telegram `next_offset` to zero from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/telegram/offset/reset` and the CLI with explicit confirmation.
- Operators can now reject pending Telegram pairing codes from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/telegram/pairing/reject` and the dashboard.
- Operators can now revoke approved Telegram pairing entries from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/telegram/pairing/revoke` and the dashboard.
- Operators can now trigger runtime supervisor recovery directly from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/supervisor/recover` and the dashboard.
- Telegram runtime operator controls are now accessible from the CLI via `clawlite telegram status|refresh|offset-commit`.
- Telegram operator status now includes actionable hints for webhook, offset, pairing, and transport recovery.
- Operators can now clear provider suppression/cooldown directly from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/provider/recover`, the dashboard, and the CLI.
- Supervisor recovery is now also accessible from the CLI via `clawlite supervisor recover`.
- Manual autonomy wakes are now accessible from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/autonomy/wake`, the dashboard, and the CLI.
- Memory suggestions can now be refreshed and memory snapshots can be created directly from the control plane/dashboard.
- Memory snapshots can now also be rolled back directly from the control plane/dashboard with explicit confirmation.
- Discord gateway transport can now be inspected in the dashboard and refreshed from the control plane via `POST /v1/control/channels/discord/refresh`.
- Discord transport status/refresh are now also accessible from the CLI via `clawlite discord status|refresh`.
- `clawlite configure --flow quickstart|advanced` works again as a compatibility shortcut to the onboarding wizard.
- Heartbeat prompts now inject a cron-style current-time line from the workspace user timezone and skip model calls when `HEARTBEAT.md` exists but is effectively empty.
- Gateway root entrypoint now serves a richer operator dashboard backed by packaged HTML/CSS/JS assets instead of a single inline landing page, with a more operational UI/UX direction for control-plane work.
- Added dashboard state endpoints (`/v1/dashboard/state`, `/api/dashboard/state`) so the packaged UI can render recent sessions, cron state, channels, provider recovery, and self-evolution summaries without scraping raw diagnostics.
- Expanded dashboard-state payloads so the UI can render workspace runtime health, bootstrap cycle state, skills inventory summary, and memory monitor telemetry.
- Added workspace onboarding-state tracking inspired by `ref/openclaw`, so bootstrap seeding/completion survives across syncs and the dashboard can report onboarding progress more accurately.
- Synced README, docs index, and roadmap with the real repository state, validation commands, and milestone workflow.
- Enforced ClawLite identity in prompts and emitted outputs to avoid assistant-name drift (`6d5c99a`).
- Added layered tool policy resolution, then tightened tool-policy handling across memory-forget and run-skill paths (`e1a0033`, `1203c64`, `f6592b2`).
- Hardened long-running reliability for provider retries, channel dispatch/reuse, gateway background tasks, cron execution, and memory compaction/monitor persistence (`da50a2a`, `017844f`, `aefaade`, `2e891b1`, `60773a5`).
- Improved worker/session control with fail-closed spawn policy, bounded process sessions/output buffers, and lock-safe subagent cancel/synthesize (`a122d8e`, `5df5d81`, `33f28ca`).

### Changed
- Rewrote `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` as a full field reference for every config key (`503a335`).
- Cleaned `config.example.json` to essential fields only — minimal viable starter (`fbf6196`).
- Updated `README.md` with Configuration section, starter examples, and Telegram snippet (`ec6fb61`).
- Updated `docs/STATUS.md` to reflect actual completed state (2026-03-15).

### Fixed
- `TelegramChannelConfig.from_dict()` (and all channel/tool config models) broken after Pydantic v2 migration — added `Base.from_dict()` classmethod shim (`d3f8ee4`). Restored 127 tests that were failing.
- Reduced SSRF risk in web tooling with DNS-drift protections and explicit peer-IP verification (`67b52e3`, `d7e0e11`).
- Switched gateway secret comparisons to constant-time checks (`62bdf45`).
- Made key persistence paths atomic/durable (config writes, `apply_patch` writes, cron state fsync-before-replace) (`58d2136`, `4f05059`, `9075e8c`).
- Added timeout guards to gateway engine runs, session runners, and cron callbacks to prevent stuck loops (`64e5b02`, `a122d8e`, `2e891b1`).
- Restored provider tool schema/Codex tool-call compatibility and hardened MCP transport retries (`4077792`, `75e154e`).

### Removed
- No explicit removals in this release window.

### Technical/Agentic Session
- [SESSION ID: CLAWLITE-UNRELEASED-HARDENING] - Focus: post-beta hardening for safety, reliability, and runtime control.
- **Objective:** consolidate high-risk fixes and OpenClaw-compatibility tooling while preserving ClawLite behavior under sustained operation.

### Technical Changes
- Added identity enforcement, OpenClaw-compatible aliases, `apply_patch`/process tools, and session/subagent orchestration tools.
- Introduced layered tool-policy resolution and gateway tools catalog exposure.
- Hardened provider/channel/gateway/cron/memory paths with bounded buffers, retries, timeouts, async offloading, and lock-safe cancellation.
- Applied security controls across web-fetch SSRF checks, constant-time gateway auth compare, and atomic/durable file writes.

### Design Decisions
- Prioritized defense-in-depth and fail-closed defaults on runtime-critical paths.
- Scoped changes to commit-backed hardening milestones instead of introducing new feature domains.

### Verification Status
- Verified through iterative runtime smoke paths, gateway execution-timeout checks, cron stability checks, and regression fixes shipped as focused patches.

## [v0.5.0-beta.2] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- New modular subsystem implementations for engine, dynamic tools, event bus, channels, scheduler, providers, session store, config loader, workspace templates, gateway, and CLI command interface (`c729d9b`, `1de0a80`, `153eedc`, `c9dd253`, `1dd1e7e`, `e4e6d24`, `c7f0d33`, `ac5537e`, `0593ea9`, `3afa9d5`, `6dba831`).

### Technical/Agentic Session
- [SESSION ID: CLAWLITE-V050B2-MODULAR-REWRITE] - Focus: full modular architecture migration with legacy retirement.
- **Objective:** transition ClawLite from a tightly coupled runtime to explicit subsystem boundaries without breaking core operator workflows.

### Technical Changes
- Split runtime responsibilities into dedicated modules across core execution, tools, bus, channels, scheduling, providers, session/config/workspace, gateway, and CLI.
- Unified orchestration through shared request/response contracts and AgentLoop-based routing.
- Replaced legacy bundles with package-local skill discovery and updated docs/runtime conventions.

### Design Decisions
- Established module boundaries before feature parity expansion to limit regression blast radius.
- Removed legacy paths once equivalent modular paths were live to avoid dual-stack drift.

- [SESSION ID: CLAWLITE-V040-FOUNDATION] - Focus: bootstrap the first complete ClawLite runtime baseline.
- **Objective:** deliver a functional initial release spanning CLI, gateway, onboarding/configuration, skills catalog, dashboard APIs/ws, and docs.

### Technical Changes
- Implemented foundational runtime surfaces (CLI/runtime/memory/tools/installer) and initial gateway onboarding flow.
- Shipped broad skills catalog and registry support to make the runtime useful from day one.
- Added dashboard API/WebSocket streams plus follow-up telemetry/chat integration for an operable control surface.

### Design Decisions
- Prioritized end-to-end operability and feature breadth over deep subsystem optimization in the first milestone.
- Established API/ws-backed dashboard early to keep operations visible while other subsystems matured.

### Verification Status
- Validated through foundational smoke runs and integration tests spanning CLI, gateway, and dashboard pathways.
